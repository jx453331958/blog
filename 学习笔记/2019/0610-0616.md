`Promise.all` lets you know when either all input promises have fulfilled or when one of them rejects.

`Promise.race` is useful if you want to run multiple promises, and either…

1. do something with the first successful result that comes in (in case one of the promises fulfills), or
2. do something as soon as one of the promises rejects.

`Promise.allSettled` gives you a signal when all the input promises are settled, which means they’re either fulfilled or rejected. This is useful in cases where you don’t care about the state of the promise, you just want to know when the work is done, regardless of whether it was successful.

`Promise.any` gives you a signal as soon as one of the promises fulfills. This is similar to Promise.race, except any doesn’t reject early when one of the promises rejects.
