**[The problem with web components](https://adamsilver.io/articles/the-problem-with-web-components/)**

1. custom CSS pseudo selectors can’t be used with web components
2. they don’t work seamlessly with native elements and their associated APIs
3. if we wanted to create a custom button, for example, we can’t extend the HTMLButtonElement directly, we have to extend the HTMLElement
4. They are not widely supported
5. They are easily misunderstood and misused
6. They are hard to compose
7. They can’t just be dropped into an application
8. Framework agnostic components without web components
