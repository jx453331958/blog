**[The 10 Component Commandments](https://dev.to/selbekk/the-10-component-commandments-2a7f)**

1. Stable versioning
   One of the most important things to consider when you're creating an API, is to keep it as stable as possible. That means minimizing the amount of breaking changes over time. If you do have breaking changes, make sure to write extensive upgrade guides, and if possible, provide a code-mod that automates that process for the consumer.

    If you're publishing your API, make sure to adhere to Semantic Versioning. This makes it easy for the consumer to decide what version is required.

2. Descriptive error messages
   Whenever an error occurs when calling your API, you should do your best to explain what went wrong, and how to fix it.

3. Minimize developer surprise
   While we're speaking of minimizing stuff - minimize your API as well. Tons of features are all well and good, but the less surface your API has, the less your consumers will have to learn. That - in turn - is perceived as an easy API to use!

    There are always ways to control the size of your APIs - one is to refactor out a new API from your old one.

4. Document the usage
   There are several ways to document components, but in our view there are 3 options that we want to recommend:

    - Storybook
    - Styleguidist
    - Docz

5. Allow for contextual semantics
6. Avoid boolean props in some cases
   Boolean properties often doesn't scale with changing requirements. Instead - try to use enumerated values like strings for values that might have a chance to become anything other than a binary choice.

7. Use `props.children`
   The reason for this is that it's much easier to use than having a content prop or something else that typically only accepts a simple value like text.

    ```javascript
    <TableCell content="Some text" />

    // vs

    <TableCell>Some text</TableCell>
    ```

8. Let the parent hook into internal logic
   Quickly summarized, this pattern of passing in a "state reducer" function to your component will let the consumer access all the actions dispatched inside of your component. You could change the state, or trigger side-effects even. It's a great way to allow for a high level of customization, without all the props.
    ```javascript
    function MyCustomDropdown(props) {
        const stateReducer = (state, action) => {
            if (action.type === Dropdown.actions.CLOSE) {
                buttonRef.current.focus();
            }
        };
        return (
            <>
                <Dropdown stateReducer={stateReducer} {...props} />
                <Button ref={buttonRef}>Open</Button>
            </>
        )
    }
    ```

9. Spread the remaining props
    Whenever you create a new component - make sure to spread the remaining props onto whatever element makes sense.
    ```javascript
    function ToolTip({ isVisible, ...rest }) {
        return isVisible ? <span role="tooltip" {...rest} /> : null;
    }
    ```

10. Give sufficient defaults
    Whenever you can, make sure to provide sufficient defaults for your props. This way, you can minimize the amount of props you have to pass - and it simplifies your implementation a great deal.

    Take the example of an onClick handler. If you're not requiring one in your code, provide a noop-function as a default prop. This way, you can call it in your code as if it was always provided.

11. Don't rename HTML attributes
    HTML as a language comes with its own props - or attributes, and it is in itself the API of the HTML elements. Why not keep using this API?

12. Write prop types (or types)
    No documentation is as good as documentation that lives inside your code. React comes fully kitted out with a great way to declare your component APIs with the prop-types package.

13. Design for the developers
    Make sure your API and "component experience" is optimized for the people that will use it - your fellow developers.
