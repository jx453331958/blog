**[Mithril.js 2: A JavaScript Framework for Building Brilliant Applications](https://mithril.js.org/)**

1. Mithril is a modern client-side JavaScript framework for building Single Page Applications. It's small (< 10kb gzip), fast and provides routing and XHR utilities out of the box.
2. [Framework comparison](https://mithril.js.org/framework-comparison.html)
    1. React:
        1. They both use virtual DOM, lifecycle methods and key-based reconciliation
        2. They both organize views via components
        3. They both use JavaScript as a flow control mechanism within views
        4. React is a view library, so a typical React-based application relies on third-party libraries for routing, XHR and state management.
        5. Mithril has built-in modules for common necessities such as routing and XHR.
    2. Angular：
        1. Both support componentization
        2. Both have an array of tools for various aspects of web applications (e.g. routing, XHR)
        3. The most obvious difference between Angular and Mithril is in their complexity.
    3. Vue:
        1. They both use virtual DOM and lifecycle methods
        2. Both organize views via components

**[Practical Ways to Write Better JavaScript](https://dev.to/taillogs/practical-ways-to-write-better-javascript-26d4)**

1. Use TypeScript

    1. TypeScript enforces "type safety".
    2. Typescript types, make refactoring larger applications possible.
    3. TypeScript makes team architecture communication easier.

2. Use Modern Features

    1. `async` and `await`
    2. `let` and `const`
    3. Arrow `=>` Functions
    4. Spread Operator `...`
    5. Template Literals (Template Strings)
    6. Object Destructuring

3. Always Assume Your System is Distributed

4. Lint Your Code and Enforce a Style

    1. Eslint is a traditional "linter", most of the time, it's going to identify issues with your code that have less to do with style, and more to do with correctness.
    2. Prettier is a code formatter. It is less concerned with "correctness", and far more worried about uniformity and consistency. Prettier isn't going to complain about using var, but it will automatically align all the brackets in your code. In my personal development process, I always run prettier as the last step before pushing code to Git. In many cases, it even makes sense to have Prettier run automatically on each commit to a repo. This ensures that all code coming into source control has consistent style and structure.

5. Test Your Code

    1. Test Driver - Ava: Test drivers are simply frameworks that give structure and utilities at a very high level. They are often used in conjunction with other, specific testing tools, which vary based on your testing needs.
    2. Spies and Stubs - Sinon: Spies give us "function analytics" such as how many times a function was called, what they were called by, and other insightful data.
    3. Mocks - Nock: HTTP mocking is the process of faking some part of the http request process, so the tester can inject custom logic to simulate server behavior.
    4. Web Automation - Selenium

6. Two Other Random JS Things
    1. Very rarely should you use `null`, poor `null`
    2. Numbers in JavaScript just suck, always use a radix parameter with `parseInt`
