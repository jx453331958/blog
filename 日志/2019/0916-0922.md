**[About “*.d.ts” in TypeScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21247278/about-d-ts-in-typescript)**

The "d.ts" file is used to provide typescript type information about an API that's written in JavaScript. The idea is that you're using something like jQuery or underscore, an existing javascript library. You want to consume those from your typescript code.

Rather than rewriting jquery or underscore or whatever in typescript, you can instead write the d.ts file, which contains only the type annotations. Then from your typescript code you get the typescript benefits of static type checking while still using a pure JS library.

**[What is the difference between *.d.ts vs *.ts in typescript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29196657/what-is-the-difference-between-d-ts-vs-ts-in-typescript)**

**TypeScript definition file (*.d.ts)**

These files are used for describing the "shape" of a JavaScript file for use in TypeScript.

For example, say I have the following JavaScript (Example.js):

```
function displayMessage(message) {
    alert(message);
}
```

With this file alone, my TypeScript code won't have any clue this function exists. It won't know its name and it won't know its parameters. We can fix this by describing it in a definition file as such (Example.d.ts):

```
declare function displayMessage(message: string);
```

Now I can use the function displayMessage in TypeScript without compile errors and I'll get compile errors when I use it incorrectly (for example, if I supplied 2 arguments instead of 1 I would get an error).

In short: Definition files allow you to use existing JavaScript code in TypeScript without having to rewrite the code in TypeScript.

**TypeScript file (.ts)**

This is the standard file extension you use when writing TypeScript. It will be compiled to JavaScript.
