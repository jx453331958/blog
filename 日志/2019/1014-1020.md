It's an inlined image (png), encoded in base64. It can make a page faster: the browser doesn't have to query the server for the image data separately, saving a round trip.

(It can also make it slower if abused: these resources are not cached, so the bytes are included in each page load.)

How does Base64 help pagespeed?

The main benefit is that a webpage does not have to load an external image. Reducing the things a webpage has to load will naturally make that page faster.

Then why use it?

There are many non important images on a page that will not affect you or your traffic if they were not indexed.

The best example would be social icons.

All those little twitter, Google+, Facebook, etc. images are really small, and have no need to be indexed. You will never gain traffic from your tiny twitter icon.

In fact when you really look at the images on your page you may find many images that fall into this definition. Think about images that are just there for design like "bottom-left-corner.png" or "quotation-mark.jpg". Things like these are just not important to your SEO but are still slowing down your pages.

Many webpages have 8 or 12 social icons and each of those is an additional HTTP request that simply does not need to be downloaded at all if you use base64.

Other considerations

It is best to only base64 encode tiny images. If you try to base64 larger images you will end up with a great deal of code in your html and lose out on the performance benefits.
