When a software runs on a target Operating system on a computer it needs access to the computer's RAM to:
- load its own bytecode that needs to be executed.
- store the data values and data structures used by the program that is executed.
- load any run-time systems that are required for the program to execute.

When a software program uses memory there are two regions of memory they use, apart from the space used to load the bytecode, Stack and Heap memory.

The satck is used for static memory allocation and as the name suggests it is a last in first out stack.
Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation and unlike stack, the program needs to look up the data in heap using pointers.
