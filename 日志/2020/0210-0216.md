**[Demystifying memory management in modern programming languages](https://deepu.tech/memory-management-in-programming/)**

When a software runs on a target Operating system on a computer it needs access to the computer's RAM to:

- load its own bytecode that needs to be executed.
- store the data values and data structures used by the program that is executed.
- load any run-time systems that are required for the program to execute.

When a software program uses memory there are two regions of memory they use, apart from the space used to load the bytecode, Stack and Heap memory.

The satck is used for static memory allocation and as the name suggests it is a last in first out stack.
Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation and unlike stack, the program needs to look up the data in heap using pointers.

Memory management of the stack is simple and straightforward and is done by the OS.

Stack used in JavaScript, objects are stored in Heap and referenced when needed.

Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation and unlike stack, the program needs to look up the data in heap using pointers
It is slower than stack as the process of looking up data is more involved but it can store more data than the stack.

Heap is shared among threads of an application.

Garbage collection approaches:

- Mark & Sweep GC
- Reference counting GC

**Conclusion:**
**What difference between stack and heap?**
|stack|heap|
|:-|:-|
|The stack is used for static memory allocation. The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.|The process of storing and retrieving data from stack is faster than heap.|
| The data that is stored on the stack has to be finite and static. It means the size of data is known at compile-time.|The data with dynamic size can be stored on the heap.|
|Multi-threaded applications can have a stack per thread.|Heap is shared among threads of an application.|
|There is a limit on the size of value that can be stored on the stack for most languages.|There is no limit on the size of value that can be stored on the heap. But there is the upper limit of how much memory is allocated to the application.|

**What means static memory allocation?**
A: In computer programming, a static variable is a variable that has been allocated "statically", meaning that its lifetime is the entire run of the program. Static memory allocation is the allocation of memory at compile time, before the associated program is executed.

**What means dynamic memory allocation?**
A: Memory is allocated as required at run time.

**[argc and argv](http://crasseux.com/books/ctutorial/argc-and-argv.html)**

Summary:
- The name of the variable argc stands for "argument count". "argc" contains the number of argument that passed to the program.
- The "argv" variable stands for "argument vector". This is a one-dimensional array, and argv is a one-dimensional array of strings. Each string is one of the arguments that was passed to the program.

**[缓冲输入与非缓冲输入](https://blog.csdn.net/Johan_Joe_King/article/details/84749703)**

缓冲区：
1、对于立即回显，不需要缓冲区，即非缓冲输入，输入的内容程序立即可用
2、对于延迟回显，会有一个缓冲区存放输入的若干个字符，并在按下回车的时候将字符串交给程序使用，并清空缓存

为什么需要缓冲区：
1、将若干个字符作为一个块发送给程序比把字符逐个发送要来得更快，这是输入长字符串时缓冲输入的优势
2、容错性，主要是容用户的错，比如输入hello却输入成了jello，用户发现后还来得及修改，但非缓冲输入就没有机会了

缓冲输入的缓存分为两类：
1、完全缓冲I/O：缓冲区满的时候被清空，缓冲内容发送到目的地，常见于文件输入
2、行缓冲I/O：典型的就是键盘输入，回车换行的时候清空缓存，内容发送到目的地

**[How to Create a File in Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/create-a-file-in-linux/)**

**Creating a File with touch Command**
```shell
touch file1.txt
```
If the file file1.txt doesn’t exist the command above will create it, otherwise, it will change its timestamps.

**Creating a File with the Redirection Operator**
```shell
> file1.txt
```
The `>` operator will overwrite an existing file, while the `>>` operator will append the output to the file.

**Creating a File with cat Command**
```shell
cat > file1.txt
```

**Creating a File with echo Command**
```shell
echo "Some line" > file1.txt
```

**Creating a File using Heredoc**
```shell
<< EOF > file1.txt
Some line
Some other line
EOF
```

**[Linux chmod command](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uchmod.htm)**

The letters u, g, and o stand for "user", "group", and "other". The "a" standards for all users.

```shell
-rwxrw-r-- 1   hope   hopestaff  123   Feb 03 15:36   file.txt
```

The first character represents the file type: "-" for a regular file, "d" for a directory, "l" for a symbolic link.
