**[How do you use the 'files' and 'directories' properties in package.json?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40795836/how-do-you-use-the-files-and-directories-properties-in-package-json)**

As for directories, I typically list the lib (for es5), src (for es6, coffeescript, typescript etc sources), dist (for browser or vm-specific builds), test, output (for temporary generated files like coverage reports, etc), doc, etc. Though this property isn't used directly by npm or other tools, it makes the directory structure explicit. Also, it makes the directories referenceable in npm scripts like so:

```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rm -rf $npm_package_directories_dist $npm_package_directories_output",
  "lint": "eslint $npm_package_directories_src",
  "test": "teenytest $npm_package_directories_test",
}
```
