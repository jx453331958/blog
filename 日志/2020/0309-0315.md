**[4 Best Practices to Write Quality JavaScript Modules](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-modules-best-practices/)**

1. Prefer named exports: Favor named module exports to benefit from renaming refactoring and code autocomplete.
2. No work during import: When imported, the module shouldnâ€™t execute any heavy work. Rather, the consumer should decide when to perform runtime operations.
3. Favor high cohesion modules: Favor high cohesion modules whose functions, classes, variables are closely related and perform a common task. Refactor big low cohesion modules by splitting them into multiple high cohesion ones.
4. Avoid long relative paths: Use absolute paths instead of the long relative paths.
