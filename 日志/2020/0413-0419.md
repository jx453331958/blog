**[Profiling React.js Performance](https://addyosmani.com/blog/profiling-react-js/)**

[Prifiler API](https://reactjs.org/docs/profiler.html)

- The Profiler takes an onRender callback as a prop that is called any time a component in the tree being profiled commits an update.
- The Profiler's onRender callback accepts parameters that describe what was rendered and the length of time it took. These include:
  - id: The "id" prop of the Profiler tree that just committed
  - phase: "mount" (if tree mounted) or "update" (if re-rendered)
  - actualDuration: time rendering the committed update
  - baseDuration: estimated time to render full subtree without memoization
  - startTime: time when Reach began rendering the update
  - commitTime: time when React committed the update
  - interactions: interactions belonging to the update
  
1. Use Profiler API
2. Use Interaction Tracing API
3. Use Puppeteer
4. Use User Timing API
5. DevTools & Lighthouse

**[What's new in ECMAScript 2020](https://www.strictmode.io/articles/whats-new-es2020/)**

Dynamic import()
```
// ...
const mod = figure.kind === "rectangle" ? "rectangle.js" : "circle.js";
const { calcSquare } = await import(mod);
console.log(calcSquare(figure));
```

Nullish coalescing
```
const initialVal = 0;

// old way
const myVar = initialVal || 10; // => 10

// new way
const myVar = initialVal ?? 10; // => 0
```

Optional chaining
```
const user = { name: "John" };

// Fails with `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'city' of undefined`
const city = user.address.city;

// Works but verbose
let city = "Not Set";
if (user.address !== undefined && user.address !== null) {
  city = user.address.city;
}

// Works and concise but requires a 3rd party library
const city = _.get(user, "address.city", "Not Set");

// ðŸ¤—
const city = user?.address?.city ?? "Not Set";
```

BigInt
```
const x = 9007199254740991n;

// or it can be constructed from a string
const y = BigInt("9007199254740991234");
```

String.matchAll
```
const tweet = "#JavaScript is full of #surprises. Both good and bad ones #TIL";

for (h of tweet.matchAll(/(#\w+)/g)) {
  console.log(h[0]);
}

// or

const tags = [...tweet.matchAll(/(#\w+)/g)]
```

Promise.allSettled
The new allSettled behaves differently. It resolves whenever all of the promises finished working, that is, became either fulfilled or rejected. It resolves to an array that contains both the status of the promise and what it resolved to (or an error).

Thus, allSettled is never rejected. It's either pending, or resolved.
```
// const urls = [...]
try {
  await Promise.all(urls.map(fetch))
} catch (e) {
  // at least one fetch is rejected here, but there may others still pending
  // so it may be too early for removing the loading indicator
  removeLoading()
}

// with allSettled
await Promise.allSettled(urls.map(fetch))
removeLoading()
```

globalThis
The new globalThis property abstracts away the difference. Meaning that you can always refer to globalThis without caring in which context you are now.
