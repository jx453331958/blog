**[Profiling React.js Performance](https://addyosmani.com/blog/profiling-react-js/)**

[Prifiler API](https://reactjs.org/docs/profiler.html)

- The Profiler takes an onRender callback as a prop that is called any time a component in the tree being profiled commits an update.
- The Profiler's onRender callback accepts parameters that describe what was rendered and the length of time it took. These include:
  - id: The "id" prop of the Profiler tree that just committed
  - phase: "mount" (if tree mounted) or "update" (if re-rendered)
  - actualDuration: time rendering the committed update
  - baseDuration: estimated time to render full subtree without memoization
  - startTime: time when Reach began rendering the update
  - commitTime: time when React committed the update
  - interactions: interactions belonging to the update
  
1. Use Profiler API
