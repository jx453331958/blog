**[Announcing TypeScript 3.9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-9/)**

- Improvements in Inference and Promise.all
- `awaited` Type
- `// @ts-expect-error` Comments
  - Pick ts-expect-error if:
    - you’re writing test code where you actually want the type system to error on an operation
    - you expect a fix to be coming in fairly quickly and you just need a quick workaround
    - you’re in a reasonably-sized project with a proactive team that wants to remove suppression comments as soon affected code is valid again
  - Pick ts-ignore if:
    - you have an a larger project and and new errors have appeared in code with no clear owner
    - you are in the middle of an upgrade between two different versions of TypeScript, and a line of code errors in one version but not another.
    - you honestly don’t have the time to decide which of these options is better.

- Uncalled Function Checks in Conditional Expressions
- Editor Improvements
- CommonJS Auto-Imports in JavaScript
- Code Actions Preserve Newlines
- Quick Fixes for Missing Return Expressions
- Support for “Solution Style” tsconfig.json Files
