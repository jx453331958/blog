**[A Complete Walkthrough to Using WebGL](https://xem.github.io/articles/webgl-guide.html)**

The workflow of a WebGL program can be summarized like this:
1. The JavaScript code initializes the WebGL program and pilots it to draw a 2D or 3D scene on the webgl context of a HTML5 canvas.
2. A first GLSL script called vertex shader is executed for every vertex of the scene. It computes an abstract, mathematical model of the scene and hands it to a second GLSL script.
3. The second GLSL script, called fragment shader, is executed for every visible fragment (pixel) of the canvas. It computes each fragment's color, in a process called rasterization.
4. The fragments constitute a bitmap image stored in a color buffer, which is finally displayed on the canvas.
