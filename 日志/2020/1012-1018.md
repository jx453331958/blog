**[Presenting v7.0.0 of the npm CLI](https://github.blog/2020-10-13-presenting-v7-0-0-of-the-npm-cli/)**

features:
- Workspaces: a set of features to the npm CLI that provide support to managing multiple packages from within a singular top-level, root package
- Automatically installing peer dependencies: prior to npm 7 developers needed to manage and install their own peer dependencies. The new peer dependency algorithm ensures that a validly matching peer dependency is found at or above the peer-dependent’s location in the node_modules tree.
- package-lock v2 and support for yarn.lock: Our new package-lock format will unlock the ability to do deterministically reproducible builds and includes everything npm will need to fully build the package tree. Prior to npm 7 yarn.lock files were ignored, the npm cli can now use yarn.lock as source of package metadata and resolution guidance.

Breaking changes:
- Automatically installing peer dependencies.
- npm uses the package.exports field making it no longer possible to require() npm’s internal modules.
- npx has been completely rewritten to use the npm exec command.
- The output of npm audit has significantly changed both in the human-readable and --json output styles.
