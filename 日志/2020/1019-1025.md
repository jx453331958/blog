**[Webpack 5 release](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/)**
General direction
- Improve build performance with Persistent Caching.
- Improve Long Term Caching with better algorithms and defaults.
- Improve bundle size with better Tree Shaking and Code Generation.
- Improve compatibility with the web platform.
- Clean up internal structures that were left in a weird state while implementing features in v4 without introducing any breaking changes.
- Prepare for future features by introducing breaking changes now, allowing us to stay on v5 for as long as possible.

Removals:
- IgnorePlugin and BannerPlugin must now be passed only one argument that can be an object, string or function.
- require.include has been deprecated and will emit a warning by default when used.
- Node.js Polyfills Removed

Changes:
- Deterministic Chunk, Module IDs and Export names
- Real Content Hash
- Named Chunk IDs
- Module Federation: allows multiple webpack builds to work together.
