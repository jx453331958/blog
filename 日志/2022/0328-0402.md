**[What’s new in Node.js core? March 2022 edition](https://simonplend.com/whats-new-in-node-js-core-march-2022-edition/)**

Deep clone values with structuredClone()
We no longer need to use hacks to deep clone objects in Node.js.

Automatically cancel async operations with AbortSignal.timeout()
In Node.js you can now automatically cancel async operations, such as a slow HTTP request.

The Fetch API in Node.js
Making HTTP requests in Node.js just got easier with an experimental Fetch API implementation.

Import JSON in ES modules
Node.js now supports importing JSON files in ES modules without the need to pass an experimental flag.

Provide context with abortSignal.reason
It’s now possible to provide a reason value when triggering an abort signal in Node.js.

Avoid boilerplate code when handling abort signals
The abortSignal.throwIfAborted() method makes it easier to write code that handles abort signals.

Take advantage of promise-based APIs in Node.js
There’s another pretty new promise-based API in Node.js core: the readline/promises API.
